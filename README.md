# no-repeat-poets
Poems from PoetryDB rendered as though each poet could only use each word (almost) only once per collection of poems.

This a probject to do a few things:

 - Play around with git/github for version control and use it regularly.
 - Use Handlebars templating to render page content from API requests.
 - Accept user input to generate requests.
 - Play with different user customizing options (starting with limiting length of lines in poems).
 - Explore improving code from first-draft spaghetti garbage to some more readable, maintainable garbage.
 - Experience problems safely!
 
 I welcome pull requests and contributions.
 
 Happy no-repeating!
